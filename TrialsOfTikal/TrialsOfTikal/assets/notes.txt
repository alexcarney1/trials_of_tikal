-entity needs a constructor we can call from derived classes
that sets GridXPos, GridYPos,, and is walkable. This will clear 3 warnings.
--clean up level loader make it more robust
--queue up movement so it feels snappier
--PlayerMove and Push have copy pasta code. Could
be its own simplemove component down the line
--maybe light beams to direct

URGENT TO DO:
--maybe move win condition check to post update
--TryToPush and playerMove :: cant walk on walkable layer 2 artifacts.
^^^not sure this is a glitch actually
--tag boxes to die after lava insteaf of current hack

CHEESE NOTES:

sprite pos need to be setpos(y,x) for rendering....!
