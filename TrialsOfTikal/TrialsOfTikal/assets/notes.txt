-entity needs a constructor we can call from derived classes
that sets GridXPos, GridYPos,, and is walkable. This will clear 3 warnings.
--clean up level loader make it more robust
--queue up movement so it feels snappier
--PlayerMove and Push have copy pasta code. Could
be its own simplemove component down the line


URGENT TO DO:
--TryToPush and playerMove :: only checking collison on one layer or whatever.
Broken for lava.


CHEESE NOTES:

sprite pos need to be setpos(y,x) for rendering....!
